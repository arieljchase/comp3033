This lab is for you to practice working with Node and NPM.  To complete the lab:

- Create a node application called lab2 ✅
- Initialize npm and create package.json via the wizard ✅
- Install the nodemon module so your application automatically restarts any time a change is saved to your server.js file ✅
- Install the connect module with npm and save it to package.json ✅
- Create server.js ✅
- Link to the connect and url packages ✅
- Write a GET /lab2 handler function that parses the url for 3 parameters: method, x, and y ✅
- Possible values for the method parameter are: "add", "subtract", "multiply", and "divide" ✅
- If the method value is anything else, show an error message ✅
- Determine which math operation to run based on the value of the method parameter ✅
- Perform this math operation on the other 2 values (x and y) ✅
- Return the full math operation as a JSON object in this format: ✅

{
  "x": "16",
  "y": "4",
  "operation": "add",
  "result": "20"
}
